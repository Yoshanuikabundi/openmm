Unsafe Rust bindings to the C++ OpenMM library

## bindgen

Bindings are generated automatically by the [bindgen](https://crates.io/crates/bindgen) crate
when the crate is built.

### Notes
- The `-fkeep-inline-functions` flag is passed the the C++ compiler so that inline functions
can be used by Rust code. This may cause performance problems â€” we'll have to see.
- The `improper_ctypes` lint is disabled, as several functions return opaque hidden types that
appear to Rust as arrays.
